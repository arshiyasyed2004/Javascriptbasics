//in js, we don't have different dataypes like int and float to distinguish between decimals, and whole number
//Instead we have one datatype, (maybe you guessed it) called numbers for everything

let num1 = 3.55;
let num2 = 5;

let sum = num1+num2;
let div = num1/num2;
let mul = num1*num2;
console.log(sum);
console.log(div);
console.log(mul);
console.log(typeof(num1)); //output: gives number, in Javascript usually we dont have datatypes, we have only number,string.
