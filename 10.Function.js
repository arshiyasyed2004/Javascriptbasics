//OP:-
// 
// === Code Execution Successful ===
//why is there no output for this?, it is because we haven't print anything on the console
let y=square(8);
console.log(y);
//O/P
// 64

//Function declaration
function name(params){
    //executable statements
}

//Function Expression
const mane= function (params){

const aenm= (params) ==>{
    //executable statements
}
